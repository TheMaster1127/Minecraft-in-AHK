This project is a Minecraft-inspired game developed in AutoHotkey v1.1.


To play, launch the .exe file if you don't have AutoHotKey (AHK) installed, the timer starts when you begin moving; otherwise, you can consider what you should do. The timer stops when you place a diamond block, and the time is saved in Your Times.txt file in the same folder. Good luck.

The game took 35 hours of work across 10 days only me i only worked on it TheMaster1127

The game is made from scrach no libs just pure AutoHotKey
